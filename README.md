I'm creating this app to help a friend who has a mobile bartending business.

He wanted an app where customers could enter their favorite ingredients and come up
with a list of drinks that include those ingredients.

I couldn't find a free api to do this but was able to find a csv file that included
this information which I imported into mongodb.

You can find that file here:
